Given the first 2 terms a1 and a2 of an Arithmetic Series. Find the nth term of the series.&nbsp;
Examples:
Input: a1 = 2, a2 = 3, n = 4
Output: 5
Explanation: The series is: 2,3,4,5,6.... Thus, the 4th term is 5.
Input: a1 = 1, a2 = 3, n = 10
Output: 19
Explanation: The series is: 1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19,21.. Thus, the 10th term is 19.
Constraints:-104 &lt;= a1 , a2 &lt;= 1041 &lt;= n &lt;= 104
